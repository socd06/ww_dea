GETTING STARTED:

1. Open the WINDOWS EXPLORER program on your PC.

2. Create a new folder on your C: drive, for example called DEAP, by 
using the File/New/Folder option.

3. Copy ALL the files associated with DEAP into this folder, using
the File/Copy option or by "drag-and-drop".

4. If the files are stored in a DEAP.ZIP file, you will then need
to unzip (extract) the files by double-clicking on the zip file and 
extracting the contents of the zip file into the DEAP folder.


FILES USED BY DEAP

DEAP uses three files when it conducts an analysis.  These are:
	- a data file (eg. eg1.dta)
	- an instruction/command file (eg. eg1.cmd)
	- an output file (eg. eg1.out)

All of these files are text files.  They can be edited using many programs.
For example, NOTEPAD, WORDPAD, WORD, WORD PERFECT, etc.  
We suggest you use WORDPAD to view and edit these files.

We suggest that you associate the file extensions ".dta", ".cmd" and ".out"
with the WORDPAD editor.  
To do this for the ".dta" file extension, double-click on a file which has 
this extension (eg. eg1.dta).  You will then be asked to select a program
to open this file with.  Select WORDPAD from the list and click "OK".  The 
eg1.dta file will then be opened in WORDPAD for you to view or edit.
Furthermore, from now on, whenever you double-click a ".dta" file, it will
be opened in WORDPAD for you.

You should repeat this process for ".cmd" and ".out" files.
You only need to do this once - your computer will then store these settings.

If you wish to change file association settings at a later date, you can use 
the View/FolderOptions/FileTypes option in WINDOWS EXPLORER.

To check that the file associations have worked you can double-click on
eg1.dta, eg1.cmd and eg1.out to look at their contents.


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

To practice running DEAP double-click on the DEAP.EXE file name.  
The program will then ask for an instruction file name.  Type in 
	eg1.cmd 
(and hit the RETURN key).  DEAP will only take a few seconds to complete
this small example.  To look at the output file (eg1.out) you then
simply double-click on the eg1.out file name.   


FILE NAMES IN DOS

DEAP is a DOS computer program.  In DOS all file names must satisfy certain
restrictions:
	- no more than 12 characters
	- no more than 3 characters after the period (".")
	- no more than 8 characters before the period
That is, the largest possible file name has the form:
	XXXXXXXX.XXX
The file extensions ".dta", ".cmd" and ".out" are chosen to help the user
remember the contents of each file.  The user need not conform to these
conventions.  For example, you could instead use a ".dat" extension for
data files if you wished.

Note that the ".ins" file extension was generally used for instruction/command
files in CEPA software in the past.  However, we have decided to change to the 
use of the ".cmd" file extension because WINDOWS 95 (and higher) have begun 
using the ".ins" file extension on their internet settings files - so we have 
changed to ".cmd" to avoid confusion.


DATA FILE STRUCTURE

All data, instruction and output files are text files.  In the data file
the output columns are listed first followed by the input columns (left to
right across the file).  If you are doing a cost eff DEA the input price 
columns are listed to the right of these.  If you are doing Malmquist DEA
all observations for year 1 are listed first, then those for year 2, and 
so on down the file.  Note that there should be no column names in the 
data file, only numbers.  For further details see the manual.


CREATING A NEW INSTRUCTION/COMMAND FILE

The easiest way to create a new instruction/command file is to open 
an existing instruction/command file (eg. eg1.cmd) using WORDPAD and then save
it under a new name (eg. abc2.cmd).  This is done by using the File/SaveAs
option in WORDPAD.  Then you can edit the contents of this new file to suit
your new analysis.


CREATING DATA FILES USING EXCEL

Many people store their data in Excel files.  To construct a text file from
an Excel file, open the file in Excel and then use the File/SaveAs option in 
Excel and save it as a text file.  However, be sure to remove any column names 
first - the data file should only contain numbers.
